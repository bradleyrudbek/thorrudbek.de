*Rudbek's* is about good food and good company. *Rudbek's* is also about
philosophy and language. It is also about love and friendship. *Rudbek's*
is almost like Ubik but quite not so. A little bit like the Encyclopaedia
Galactica, but not as expensive.

It may also even be about Data Janitorial endeavours. Who knows. We
stand for all those things. We also stand for an open web and open 
standards. Please checkout the [Brave Project](https://www.brave.com)
